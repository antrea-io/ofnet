# Ofnet

Ofnet is a Golang networking library to help write Openflow controllers to
manage Openflow switchess.

This repository started as a fork of
[contiv/ofnet](https://github.com/contiv/ofnet), as the Contiv project is no
longer actively maintained. This repository is mainly used by Antrea, and a lot
of code that is not needed in Antrea has been removed compared to the original
Contiv repository.
